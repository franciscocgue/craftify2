## Craftify

### 07.05.2024

After Craftify PoC, this project starts as a new Craftify version. 
Changes:
- different component library
- different positioning logic (more flex-based, and less absolute-oriented)

Using vite for the frontend. Chakra ui as the component library (after a loooot of research and reddit and chatGPT).

Next: think how to position components (after PoC experience). Possibly a layout library?
